# UnlockPDF
A tool to unlock PDF printing and editing capabilities

After launching the script, you can choose multiple files and they would be saved at the folder of origin.

Currently it doesn't have password brutforcing capabilities, but it's planned.

That's my first working program with a GUI.

It's built on PikePDF code started by jbarlow83: https://github.com/pikepdf/pikepdf
