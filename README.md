# UnlockPDF
A tool to unlock PDF printing and editing capabilities

After launching the script, you can choose multiple files and they would be saved at the folder of origin.

Currently it doesn't have password brutforcing capabilities, but it's planned*.

That's my first working program with a GUI.

It's built on PikePDF code started by jbarlow83: https://github.com/pikepdf/pikepdf

* In beta branch I adapted some code to bruteforce the password. All thanks go to The Python Code: https://thepythoncode.com/article/crack-pdf-file-password-in-python
* As a bonus, there's a commented out section of an iterational algorythm that would try every possible combination in a succession. 10.000 iteration took me just 40 minutes, and it still was just 4 symbols.
